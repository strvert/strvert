<h1>Hi. This is a place for many little things.</h1>

<p>Software created for fun, code written for learning, scripts to try out features, and occasionally the results of work.
This is a junk yard where codes of various genres are placed.</p>

<p>
遊びで作ったソフト、勉強のために書いたコード、機能を試すためのスクリプト、ときには仕事の成果も。ここは様々なジャンルのコードからなるがらくた置き場です。
